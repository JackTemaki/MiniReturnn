==================
Welcome to NoRETURNN
==================

NoRETURNN is a feature-less derivative of `RETURNN <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn>`__ which only contains of basic components needed to train sequence-to-sequence models (e.g. ASR, MT or TTS) with PyTorch.
No network helper functions are provided, all model logic has to be explicitly defined by the user.
This is repository is intended to be a quick playground for custom experiments, for everything serious please use `RETURNN <https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn>`__.

General config-compatibility to RETURNN is kept, but technical details differ.
